Using these modded xml files or snippets could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files or snippets  neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files or snippets to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

These XML files will add trader items to the shop in Nadbor, with a Trader Truck parked outside.

To install these files simply upload them over the top of your existing files and restart your server..

Please note that these are Vanilla 113 files and that item spawns in the store count towards that items nominal value, so you may want to consider
increasing those values in the types.xml so items still spawn in other places.

Thanks, Rob.
